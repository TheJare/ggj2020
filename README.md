# Repair

Quick Global Game Jam 2020 entry. The theme is 'Repair'.

The initial concept: some things are breaking constantly and you have to bring
materials to repair them. You have to move the materials across an area with
constantly moving obstacles. Different materials repair different things.

We will try to tweak:
- speed at which things fail and break
- amount of obstacles
- speed and movement style of obstacles
- speed of movement of the materials
- amount of repair that materials perform on broken parts

As usual, quick & dirty javascript.

## After the fact

I devoted about 1.5 hours to set up the basic gameplay loop, 1 more hour to turn
it into a fully playable (albeit very simple) game, then half an hour more for
bits of polish and completing the compatibility with Android devices (I hope iOS
works fine too).

I tried to minimize the amount of things I brought over from previous projects,
just so that I get to refresh this stuff in my brain.
